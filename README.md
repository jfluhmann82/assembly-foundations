# Assembly Foundations
This repository documents my journey learning x86-64 assembly.  I'd learned x86 assembly in college.
I thought it would be fun to go back and work on x86-64 assembly.

Exercises in my `exercises` directory are derived from [Learn to Program with Assembly](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7437-8).  I'm doing the exercises in Intel syntax using NASM because I just like Intel syntax over AT&T syntax.

My `notes` directory captures conceptual understanding, and quick reference to thoughts or ideas I'm having as I go through.


My `experiments` directory explore OS-specific behavior, and random things I want to try.
