# Assembly Foundations
This repository documents my journey learning x86-64 assembly.

Exercises are derived from Learn to Program with Assembly (Linux, AT&T syntax), rewritten in Intel syntax using NASM for clarity.

Notes capture conceptual understanding.

Experiments explore OS-specific behavior (Linux first, Windows later).
